# Interest Calculator
This is a simple interest calculator single-page interactive website I made after finishing my course in Coursera (**Intro to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**). Just wanted to try it out on my own without using existing templates!

Try it out through this GitHub Pages [link](https://nekina.github.io/interest-calculator/)!
